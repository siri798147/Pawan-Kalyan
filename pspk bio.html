         He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems.
          Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[62] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[63] with the Congress Party,[64] Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party.[65]
